 Modify existing Guess-A-Number game to other game
  - Games created
  - Moves played
  - Game state updated
  - Game state stored
  - Gate state retrieved

 - Define/store what score is & whatever other relevant data for the game
 - Create README with 1) play instructions and 2) descriptions of endpoints
 
 - Document design decisions: additional properties added to models & why;
   Trade-offs/struggles when implementing game logic? [Design.txt]

 - Extend endpoints
   * get_user_games [probably games s/b descendents of user]
   * cancel_game - only those in progress; delete or Boolean flag
   * get_high_scores([number_of_results]) - leaderboard
   * get_user_rankings - method for ranking & endpoint that returns player name & rank
   * get_game_history - record of moves (w/results) in particular game

 - Improve notifications

Build Logic of verifying winning hand - or let other player check

MakeMoveForm - edit per game logic!

Game Logic
 - getHand - report hand of nextMove

 - each move -> startMove and endMove
startMove
   2. user inputs faceUpCard or drawPile
   3. game updates user's hand and deck (drawPile)
   4. game reports user's updated hand w/ dict representation

endMove
   5. user inputs discard and flag if going out
   6. game updates user's hand and faceUpCard with discard
   7a. if !out, game reports nextMove user's hand w/ dict representation
        and flip nextMove
   7b. elif out, game verifies user's hand as winner
   7c. alt, other user gets to verify hand (save on logic)

DONE hand_to_form()
DONE HandForm
DONE - Default list of full deck
DONE - def dealHand()
DONE - changes in models.py
DONE - Game - rename user_x, user_o
            - change board to deck [pickle-able list of ints - available cards]
            - add faceUpCard
            - add deal - int for "round"
            - add dealer - at end of round, flip
            - add p1 & p2 hands - pickle-able lists
            - add p1 & p2 points - ints
            - edit new_game & to_form & end_game

Cards displayed to user as Suit-Value (i.e. H-6)

Each card also associated with int 1-52
At beginning of game, full deck available

Round:
Deal X cards to each player
Flip top card and show
Player chooses top card or drawPile
Player discards (and optionally "goes out")
Alternate player turns until someone goes out
Verify hand once player goes out

Cards displayed to user as Suit-Value (i.e. H-6)

Each card also associated with int 1-46
At beginning of each hand, full deck available (11 * 4) + 2 = 46 cards
RandNum%46 = card dealt
if that card already dealt, try again
