 Modify existing Guess-A-Number game to other game
  - Games created
  - Moves played
  - Game state updated
  - Game state stored
  - Gate state retrieved

 - Define/store what score is & whatever other relevant data for the game
 - Create README with 1) play instructions and 2) descriptions of endpoints
 
 - Document design decisions: additional properties added to models & why;
   Trade-offs/struggles when implementing game logic? [Design.txt]

 - Extend endpoints
   * get_user_games [probably games s/b descendents of user]
   * cancel_game - only those in progress; delete or Boolean flag
   * get_high_scores([number_of_results]) - leaderboard
   * get_user_rankings - method for ranking & endpoint that returns player name & rank
   * get_game_history - record of moves (w/results) in particular game

 - Improve notifications

W1, W2 = wild = Joker

Cards displayed to user as Suit-Value (i.e. H-6)

Each card also associated with int 1-46
At beginning of each hand, full deck available (11 * 4) + 2 = 46 cards
RandNum%46 = card dealt
if that card already dealt, try again

"Card" object with a Boolean flag for dealt

"Hand" object to keep track of cards

"Game" object

Round:
Deal X cards to each player
Flip top card and show
Player chooses top card or drawPile
Player discards (and optionally "goes out")
Alternate player turns until someone goes out
Verify hand once player goes out
